{"name":"FF2-Official","tagline":"Freak Fortress 2 is a one versus everyone mod for Team Fortress 2.  It is the successor to the Vs. Saxton Hale mode.","body":"##Welcome to the official FF2 repository!\r\n**LATEST VERSION**: [1.9.0](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2054933&postcount=1)\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](http://198.27.69.149/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=FF2-Official)](http://198.27.69.149/jenkins/job/FF2-Official/)\r\n\r\nAll development work towards the next major version of FF2 is done in the [development](https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official/tree/development) branch.\r\nThe [stable](https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official/tree/stable) branch contains bugfixes for the most recent version of FF2.\r\nOnce changes are considered ready for release, they are merged into the [master](https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official/tree/master) branch.  This branch will always contain a released version of FF2.\r\n[Powerlord's](https://github.com/powerlord/) rewrite of FF2 is housed in the [rewrite](https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official/tree/rewrite) branch.  These changes are slowly being assimilated into the [v2](https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official/tree/) branch.\r\nFinally, the [experimental](https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official/tree/experimental) branch contains experimental work being done towards the next iteration of FF2.\r\nThe default branch is changed to reflect where the most work is currently being done.\r\n\r\n###Compiling FF2\r\n***\r\nThis tutorial assumes you have TF2 installed.\r\n\r\n####Setup Git\r\n1. Download and install Git [here](http://git-scm.com/download/).\r\n\t* It is strongly recommended to allow Git to handle `.sh` extensions if installing on Windows.\r\n2. *Optional*: Download and install a Git GUI client, such as Github for Windows/Mac, SmartGitHg, TortoiseGit, etc.  A nice list is available [here](http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).\r\n\r\n####Compile FF2\r\n1. Open up your command line.\r\n2. Navigate to your TF2 server's location, eg `C:\\Servers\\TF2\\FF2-Official\\tf` by executing `cd [folder location]`.  This location is hereby referred to as `ff2dev`.\r\n3. Execute `git clone https://github.com/50DKP/FF2-Official.git`.\r\n4. Right now, you should have a folder structure that looks like:\r\n\r\n***\r\n\tff2dev\r\n\t\\-tf\r\n\t\t\\-addons\r\n\t\t\t\\-sourcemod\r\n\t\t\t\t\\-Misc. Sourcemod files (should have `scripting` and `plugins`)\r\n***\r\n\r\n####Installing Sourcemod\r\n1. Download [Sourcemod](http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php).\r\n2. Extract it to `ff2dev` so that all the directories match up.\r\n\r\n####Compile FF2\r\n1. Navigate to `tf/addons/sourcemod/scripting` in the command prompt.\r\n2. Execute `compile.sh freak_fortress_2.sp`.\r\n\t* **NOTE**: This will only work on Windows if you allowed Git to make `.sh` bash files executable.\r\n3. The compiled file will be in `scripting/compiled`, which you can then move to `/plugins/`.\r\n\r\n####Updating Your Repository\r\nIn order to get the most up-to-date builds, you'll have to periodically update your local repository.\r\n\r\n1. Open up your command line.\r\n2. Navigate to `ff2dev` in the console.\r\n3. Make sure you have not made any changes to the local repository, or else there might be issues with Git.\r\n\t* If you have, try reverting them to the status that they were when you last updated your repository.\r\n4. Execute `git pull master`.  This pulls all commits from the official repository that do not yet exist on your local repository and updates it.\r\n\r\n###Label Information\r\n***\r\n* `bug-critical` denotes severe game-impeding bugs that generally do not have a workaround.\r\n\t* *Examples*: Server crashes, unplayable bosses, etc.\r\n* `bug-major` denotes game-impeding bugs that generally have a workaround and/or can be easily avoided.\r\n\t* *Examples*: Suicide/weapon-related bugs, etc.\r\n* `bug-minor` denotes bugs that are generally visual-only and/or do not seriously affect gameplay.  This may also include bugs that are not always reproducible.\r\n\t* *Examples*: No HUD, missing text, etc.\r\n* `feedback-required` denotes issues that require feedback from others.\r\n\t* *Examples*: Suggestions, etc.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
